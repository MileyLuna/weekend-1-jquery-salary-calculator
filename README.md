# Project Name

Weekend 1 jQuery salary calculator

## Description

_Duration: 10 hours_

For this project we needed five inputs consisting of First Name, Last Name, ID, Title, and Annual Salary. We also need a submit button to imput our variables into a table.

Within our table it will dynamtically load a delete button as well after each variable submission.
With the delete button we should be able to delete the row of that employee information.

Outside of the table, we will have a string showcasing how much the Total Monthly expense is. Once Total Monthly hits $20,000, it's color changes to red.

The challenge I face is making the delete button work and summing up the annual salary.

(View Raw will give you the markdown that you can copy to your repos!)
